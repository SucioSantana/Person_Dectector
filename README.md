# Person_Dectector
Just a little project where i was curious to use PyTorch and OpenCV  to detect people in live time from a local system. The program is set with a pretrained model that was trained on the COCO dataset that in turn makes green boxes arouund  any person that is detected by the webcam, press q to exit out of the program
